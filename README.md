# canvas-sprite-animation

This is my implementation of animation from a bunch of png/jpg files based on canvas.


Apple have used this technique on the MacBook Pro 16 promo page:

The advantage of this technique is that we will have more control over the frames loading. We can fetch frames much faster and efficient way by skiping intermediate frames.
